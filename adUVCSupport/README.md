# Installing libuvc:

Provided are shared libuvc libs built on a debian 8 machine, along with the required includes.

It is also possible to build these from source by cloning the repository on github and using cmake.

A script called installlibuvc.sh will be included, and running that will install the most recent version on
your machine.
