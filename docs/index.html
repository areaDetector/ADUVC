    <h4>Introduction:</h4>
    <p>UVC, or USB Video Class is an open Video connection standard used for USB based cameras and webcams. Almost all consumer webcams support 
        UVC, along with a large number of other consumer USB cameras of different form factors, ranging from penicl cameras to micro cameras.
        Some industrial cameras support the format as well. ADUVC is an area detector driver that adds support for UVC based cameras.
        It also includes some useful test programs to check if your UVC device is being recognized correctly.
