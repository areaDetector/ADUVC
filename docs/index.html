    <h1>ADUVC</h1>
    <h4>An EPICS driver for USB Video Class (UVC) devices</h4>

    <h4>Introduction:</h4>
    <p class="text-section-local">
        UVC, or USB Video Class is an open Video connection standard used for USB based cameras and webcams. Almost all consumer webcams support 
        UVC, along with a large number of other consumer USB cameras of different form factors, ranging from pencil cameras to micro cameras.
        Some industrial cameras support the format as well. ADUVC is an area detector driver that adds support for UVC based cameras.
        It also includes some useful test programs to check if your UVC device is being recognized correctly.
    </p>

    <h4>Installation:</h4>
    <p class="text-section-local">
        Detailed installation instructions for the ADUVC driver can be seen in the <a href="https://github.com/epicsNSLS2-areaDetector/ADUVC/blob/master/README.md">README</a>
        file. To install ADUVC, you must first install libuvc and its dependancies. The simplest way to do this is to run the provided
        bash script in the adUVCSupport directory of the repository. This installs libusub, libjpeg, and cmake, clones the
        <a href="https://github.com/ktossell/libuvc">libuvc repository on github</a>, and then builds it using cmake. The dynamic library files
        resulting from the build are placed in the /usr/local directory (on Linux), and include files must be placed in adUVCSupport/include. 
        From here you may compile the support programs or the driver itself by entering the appropriate directory (the top ADUVC dir. for the 
        driver), and compiling by switching to root and typing 'make'. The driver is now installed.
    </p>

    <h4>Driver Contents:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>install-libuvc.sh    ->  Installation script for libuvc and its dependancies.</li>
        <li>cameraDetector      ->  C++ program that detects all connected UVC devices. Useful for finding serial/product number for IOC</li>
        <li>imageCaptureTest    ->  C++ program that uses OpenCV to capture 200 frames from the camera to test if libuvc has been installed and the 
            camera is connected.
        </li>
        <li>ADUVC driver        ->  The source code for the area detector driver itself in the uvcApp/src directory.</li>
        <li>iocUVC            ->  Example ioc for use with the ADUVC driver. Shows how to connect to a camera in the EPICS IOC shell</li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <h4>Usage:</h4>
    <p class="text-section-local">
        Once the driver is installed, you may start the ioc by entering the IOC folder and running 'sudo ./st.cmd'. Sudo access is important
        because access to UVC devices is limited to users with root permissions. You may then integrate ADUVC into your area detector screen setup.
        Below is an image of the ADUVC base control screen. It extends the standard ADBase screen with UVC controls for various camera functionality,
        such as brightness, exposure, backlight compenstation, saturation, etc. The driver supports a variety of UVC formats, though the two that are used
        the most often are MJPEG and Uncompressed. Because acquisition modes are locked down in most UVC cameras, as of R1-2 there has been added a section
        to the screen that allows for selecting from up to the 7 most useful acquisition modes supported by the camera. If the camera has fewer than 7 modes,
        the remaining ones will show as Unused.
