R1-4 (18-August-2020)
----
* Features Added

    * Custom CSS Screen Added

* Key fixes and improvements
    * Fixed error where first frame in stream was corrupt
    * Fixed IOC autosave feature
    * Resolved frame drop due to motion (camera dependant)

    * Plugin interoperability tested
    * Detector IOC written and tested
    * Driver report function implemented

* Key Support Features Added
    * Documentation for installation and usage
    * Camera Detector program for detecting UVC cameras and diagnostics
    * Image Acquisition program for testing camera image acquisition
    * libuvc installation script included

* Limitations
